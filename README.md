# Simple Shell

## Description
The **Simple Shell** project is a basic UNIX command interpreter written in C.
It was developed as part of the Holberton School curriculum to understand how shells work internally.
This shell provides a prompt, reads user input, parses commands, and executes them either as built-ins or external programs using system calls.
